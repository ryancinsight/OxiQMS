# Risk Management Plan - CardiacMonitor v2.1

## 1. Executive Summary
This Risk Management Plan (RMP) defines the systematic approach for identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and controlling risks associated with the CardiacMonitor v2.1 medical device throughout its lifecycle.

## 2. Scope and Application
- **Device**: CardiacMonitor v2.1 - Advanced Cardiac Monitoring Device
- **Classification**: Class II Medical Device (FDA)
- **Standards**: ISO 14971:2019, IEC 62304, FDA 21 CFR Part 820

## 3. Risk Management Process
### 3.1 Risk Analysis
- Hazard identification using FMEA methodology
- Risk estimation using severity × probability matrix
- Risk evaluation against acceptability criteria

### 3.2 Risk Control
- Risk reduction through design controls
- Protective measures implementation
- Information for safety documentation

## 4. Risk Acceptability Criteria
- **High Risk (RPN ≥ 100)**: Unacceptable - Immediate mitigation required
- **Medium Risk (RPN 50-99)**: Conditional - Risk reduction measures needed
- **Low Risk (RPN < 50)**: Acceptable - Monitor and document
